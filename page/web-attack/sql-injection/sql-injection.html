            <h1>Understanding SQL Injection</h1>
            <p>
                SQL Injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.
                It happens when user input is improperly sanitized and directly embedded in SQL statements.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or even deletion of entire databases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hardest part about SQL injection is mapping the application to figure out if and where it is susceptible to SQL injection. This could take days or weeks.
